## Complete Binary Tree (Linked List version)

Typically this is done using arrays much more efficiently. This experiment, I did to use linked list and build logic around this to build complete binary tree. It was tricky and not found generally done, as it works with O(N^3) complexity.

Key thing to observe here is the recursion done to find siblings and it takes your mind into infinity while trying to understand how deep it can go.

Enjoy!
